\section*{Exercise 2.1 (Consumption Innovations)}
In the economy with AR(1) endowment shocks studied in section 2.2, we found that 
\[
E_t c_{t+1} = c_t
\]
which means that 
\[
c_{t+1} = c_t + \mu_{t+1},
\]
where \(\mu_{t+1}\) is a white noise process that is unforecastable given information available in \(t\). 
Derive the innovation \(\mu_{t+1}\) as a function of \(r\), \(\rho\), and \(\epsilon_{t+1}\).

\textbf{Answer:} 
\[
\mu_{t+1} = \frac{r}{1+r} \rho \epsilon_{t+1}
\]
